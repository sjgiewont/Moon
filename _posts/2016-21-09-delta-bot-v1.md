<center><b>Delta Robot</b> is a self designed robot capable of simple picking and placing using computer vision technqiues.</center>
     
#### What is a Delta Robot?
Delta robots are used in many industrial applications and are becoming increasingly popular in manufacturing applications. 

A delta robot consists of three main motors at base (top of the robot) that drive the position of a platform. This is possible due to all of the arm joints being connected via ball joints. 

Since the motors remain stationary at the base, the arms of the robot do not carry the weight of any additional motors. This allows delta robots to be very fast and accurate in their movements.


#### Inverse Kinematics

If we are tyring to move our end effector to a point (x,y,z), we can deduce the position of leg in the same plane as platform. Using the leg length (b) and arm length (a), can produce two circle functions

The intersection between the circles which will be the end point of arm. Using the end point of the arm, the requried angle of the arm can easily be calculated. Repeating this process for each arm allows all arm angular positions to be solved. 

#### System Design

This delta robot was created using:


- 3 [Hitec HS-755HB](http://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Robotics/33755.pdf){:target="_blank"} servos as the main base servos. 
- 2 [Tower Pro SG90 Micro Servos](http://arduino-ua.com/docs/SG90Servo.pdf){:target="_blank"} were used to control and wrist and gripper mounted to the platform. 
- 6 Threaded rods
- 12 End Rod Ball Joints
- 1 Wooded Stand (to hold robot)
- 3 Custom steel arms
- 1 Raspberry Pi 2
- 1 Arduino Uno
- 1 USB webcam

The main control and computation is completed on the Raspberry Pi. Commands art sent over a serial USB connection to an Arduino Uno. The Ardunio Uno would then drive all 5 servos to their appropriate values. The webcam would send a live video feed back to the Raspberry Pi over USB to be processed for various applications.
