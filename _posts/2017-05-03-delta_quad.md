<center>Walking robots are in great demand due to their ability to navigate diverse terrains. Currently, many of the robotic legs in development are constructed using serial or prismatic joints. Such leg architectures have been proven capable but have high power requirements, are limited in overall motion and are slow. This paper discusses the development of a parallel jointed leg, Delta-Leg, that capable of advanced locomotive gaits. The mechanical design and kinematics of a physical working prototype developed is discussed. The use of ANFIS (Adaptive Neural-Fuzzy Inference System) is utilized to describe the inverse kinematics and implement control of the robot. Future work will include optimization of ANFIS and construction of a quadruped using multiple Delta-Legs. Both simulated and physical implementations of various walking gaits using the quadruped design will also be analyzed in future work.  </center>
