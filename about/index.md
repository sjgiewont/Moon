Hello! Welcome to my personal blog/portfolio! 

My name is Steven Giewont and I am currently a student at Rochester Insititue of Technology studying for a BS/MS in electrical engineering. 

I'm very passionate about innovation, technology and design. I love a challenge. I love coming up with new ideas. You'll always find me working on some sort of crazy new project.
